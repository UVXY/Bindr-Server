Sam Hunter is a very successful thirty-five-year-old insurance salesman. His life is more or less complete: he's got a new Mercedes, a great condo, a 52-inch television - but no girlfriend. Then he sees Calliope, the most gorgeous creature he has ever encountered. She's exactly the kind of woman he has always wanted in his life but never had the courage even to approach. Enter Coyote, an ancient Indian god famous for his abilities as a trickster, wise in many ways, in others a total fool. He has just the medicine to bring these lovers together, but after that he hasn't got a clue. In fact, Sam Hunter was actually born Samson Hunts Alone, a Crow Indian raised on the tribe's Montana reservation. At age fifteen, when he was full of rebellion, a miscalculation with the law forced him to run away. Twenty years later, safely ensconced in his yuppie persona, that earlier life is just a distant memory. Until Coyote enters the picture. From then on, nothing is the same. From Los Angeles to Las Vegas, then back to the Montana Crow reservation Coyote Blue is the story of how Sam Hunter becomes a brave man, of how he finds love and redemption and release. It is a wonderful, spiritual, and totally uplifting tale, by turns mysterious, terrifying, and outrageous. It is a cult novel for people too smart and too hip to be part of a cult."]},

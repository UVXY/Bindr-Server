Covey", "num_pages": "372", "awards": [], "places": [], "character_names": [], "language": "English", "ISBN": "0743269519", "description": ["When Stephen Covey first released The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, the book became an instant rage because people suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were headed off in the wrong direction; and more than that, they realized that there were so many simple things they could do in order to navigate their life correctly. This book was wonderful education for people, education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a \u2018success\u2019 in life.", "But not everyone understands Stephen Covey\u2019s model fully well, or maybe there are some people who haven\u2019t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now, I am not saying that by using Covey\u2019s model, or anyone else\u2019s model for that matter, you can become a sure-shot success, but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So, where is the shortcoming?", "There are two main problems here, and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or, they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.", "The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey\u2019s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are, they can rattle them off end to end, but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book, yes, and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.", "That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey\u2019s book, or rather, his model, was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it, there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.", "But, before we barge into that area, it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first, and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life."]},

Did I ", "?\u201d Since that fateful night, Brendon has lived a fully charged life, and he\u2019s helped millions of people around the globe transform their lives and feel more alive, engaged, and fulfilled. Brendon observes that the emotional energy of the world has flatlined, and he sets out to fix it. People are stressed, restless, and wanting more out of life. Despite the fact that most people have what they \u201cneed\u201d to be happy, they rarely feel the levels of excitement, engagement, or satisfaction they deserve. So what\u2019s the solution? In ", ", Brendon argues that the only way to measurably improve the quality of your life is to learn how to activate the very 10 drives that make you most human. These drives are your desires for more control, competence, congruence, caring, connection, change, challenge, creative expression, contribution, and consciousness. These drives shape everything you think, feel, and do in life, so understanding and mastering them is critical to your success and happiness. Strategically activating these drives on a consistent basis is the fastest path to living a fully charged life. Harnessing our human drives is not easy; if it were, we wouldn\u2019t see so much restlessness in the world.

We all want more control, for example, but seeking to have more certainty in our daily lives or to control other people will actually decrease our levels of control (and happiness). We have a deep desire for change, too, but we often fail to make the right kinds of change that would make us feel more alive and in command of our lives. In ", ", Brendon helps us overcome these mistakes and illuminates the path for strategically and intelligently activating our 10 human drives so that we can have the one thing we all want: more life in our lives!

You\u2019d sleep like a dormouse, your career would leap ahead, your earnings would go off the richter scale, your relationships would be loving and happy - you would be in sync with the world. Such a life does not have to exist only in the realms of fantasy. Your dreams can come true. You can make your life the way you want it to be. The SWAP Process is, in many respects, the story of how the author has coached thousands of people to release themselves from their inhibitions and achieve what is important to them. Twenty five years of coaching experience has gone into developing this unique path to a happy, fulfilling and rewarding life. Fundamental to the process is the knowledge that when it comes to achieving what you want in life dreams are far more motivating than goals. Then, once you have the motivation, it provides a provenly effective way to move past your doubts so that you can achieve what you desire. When it comes to making your dreams come true the issue is not your lack of ability - what really hinders you are the barriers that you place across your own path - your limiting beliefs, fears and past history. These prevent you from making progress just as effectively as the disc brakes on your motor car. Ask yourself these questions: \u201cdo you have a really clear, detailed picture of how you would like your life to be? Have you developed an exciting way of making your dream come true? Do you have an effective way of overcoming your anxieties and limiting beliefs? Is your attitude as positive as the achievers you know? Are you chiselling away day after day at the Big Idea that will make your dream come true?\u201d If you answered \u201cno\u201d to any of the questions above the time has come to start making progress. The SWAP Process will make your dream glow like a magnetic flame that will light the path to your personal nirvana. It will enable you to overcome your inhibitions and hurdle your barriers so that you can experience the wonder of feeling happy and fulfilled every day. Built into the SWAP Process are a number of hypnotic suggestions that will smooth your path, make it easy for you to make your dreams to come true."]},

His agenda in this tome, which was first published in 1978 but didn't become a bestseller until 1983, is to reconcile the psychoanalytic tradition with the conflicting cultural currents roiling the 70s. In the spirit of Me-Decade individualism and libertinism, he celebrates self-actualization as life's highest purpose and flirts with the notions of open marriage and therapeutic sex between patient and analyst. But because he is attuned to the nascent conservative backlash against the therapeutic worldview, Peck also cites Gospel passages, recruits psychotherapy to the cause of traditional religion (he even convinces a patient to sign up for divinity school) and insists that problems must be overcome through suffering, discipline and hard work (with a therapist.) Often departing from the cerebral and rationalistic bent of Freudian discourse for a mystical, Jungian tone more compatible with New Age spirituality, Peck writes of psychotherapy as an exercise in \"love\" and \"spiritual growth,\" asserts that \"our unconscious is God\" and affirms his belief in miracles, reincarnation and telepathy. Peck's synthesis of such clashing elements (he even throws in a little thermodynamics) is held together by a warm and lucid discussion of psychiatric principles and moving accounts of his own patients' struggles and breakthroughs. Harmonizing psychoanalysis and spirituality, Christ and Buddha, Calvinist work ethic and interminable talking cures, this book is a touchstone of our contemporary religio-therapeutic culture.\" -- Publishers WeeklyKeywords: MIND & BODY PSYCHOLOGY SOCIOLOGY RELIGION"]},

He's tried to answer it before, but he's never had the help of a psychiatrist to get the message across in a context we can easily understand. Through conversations, stories, and meditations, the Dalai Lama shows us how to defeat day-to-day anxiety, insecurity, anger, and discouragement. Together with Dr. Cutler, he explores many facets of everyday life, including relationships, loss, and the pursuit of wealth, to illustrate how to ride through life's obstacles on a deep and abiding source of inner peace."]},
